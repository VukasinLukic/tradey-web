## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: CORS errors

**Quick Fix:**
1. Re-copy `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` from file
2. Verify it's valid JSON (use JSON validator)
3. Update variable in Railway
4. Check Railway logs for success message

### Issue: Frontend shows old code

**Quick Fix:**
1. Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click on latest deployment ‚Üí Redeploy
